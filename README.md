DjangoRestFramework: Function based Views + Serializers

Model used: Passenger(firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints)

Performed CRUD operation using serializers.

One view performs non primary key based operations(Read, Create) & second one performs primary key based operations(Update, Delete).



## SAMPLE DATA

To save time I've kept few records here. 

```insert into passenger (firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints) values ('Gerek', 'Alpin', 'galpinb@ask.com', 179);
insert into passenger (firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints) values ('Anne', 'Mizzi', 'amizzic@chicagotribune.com', 79);
insert into passenger (firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints) values ('Caleb', 'Thatcham', 'cthatchamd@bandcamp.com', 536);
insert into passenger (firstName, lastName, email, rewardPoints) values ('Nata', 'Reeder', 'nreedere@spotify.com', 381);
```
